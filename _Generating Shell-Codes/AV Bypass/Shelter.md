You have to give any executable to Shelter and it will inject and encode our malicious code inside that executable. ( Currently only able to make x32-bit executables. )

Download it form Shelter's offcial website then transfer it to windows.
Unzip it.

```sh
sudo wine shelter.exe
```

```
PE Target : /path/to/your/executable

```

Just gitve it the thing which you want to make undetectable.
I will do God-level things to make it undetectable by everything.
