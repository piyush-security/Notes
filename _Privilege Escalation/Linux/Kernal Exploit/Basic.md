## Basic Theory :
Kernels are the core of any operating system. Think of it as a layer between application software and the actual computer hardware.
The kernel has complete control over the operating system. Exploiting a kernel vulnerability can result in execution as the root user.
Basically a kernal is program that controls everything on the system.
Facilitates interactions between hardware and software components.

### Finding and using kernel exploits is usually a simple process:

- Enumerate kernel version (  `uname -a`  ).
- Find matching exploits (Google, ExploitDB, GitHub).
- Compile and run.

**Refrence** : Some kernal versions with their Exploits. [here](https://github.com/lucyoa/kernel-exploits)****‚Äù**

### System Enumeration :

###### Enumerate the kernel/Arch/System version:

```sh
uname -a                             #( Check Kernal version )
``` 

```sh
cat /proc/version                   # ( Check Kernal version )
```

```sh
cat /etc/issue                     #( Check about Linux )
```

```sh
lscpu                             #( Check which arch and CPU Details )
```

```sh
file /bin/bash                     # ( Check which arch )
```

### Common Exploit Finding :

Use **searchsploit** to find matching exploits:

```sh
searchsploit linux kernel 2.6.32 priv esc
```

**or**

Use **Linux-Exploit-Suggester-2** (on Kali ) :

```perl
./linux-exploit-suggester-2.pl -k <version_of_kernal>
```

Now Use the Exploit suggested. And use them as guided and get root!!!
